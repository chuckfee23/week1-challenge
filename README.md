Key Changes made to the existing code:

    -The source code used only <div> for every element which could make it difficult for a developer to follow, so I replaced them all with various semantic elements that are more descriptive, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <figure>, <section>, <summary>, <aside>, and <footer>.

    -Since Horiseon specialized in SEO, I added more of a contrasting color in that part of their main header and underlined to add clarity.

    -Added id's to each of the summary sections to enable the links in the nav bar to scroll to those sections smoothly.

    -Added alt attributes to all images to make the page more accessible.

    -Removed lots of redundant CSS code to consolidate and make it easier to follow in a logical manner
